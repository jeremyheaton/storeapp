Test application for revv.

Currently supports multiple users and multiple stores. Currently can not drill down into items by store.
it will only show all items of all stores. 

When a user makes an account they will have the option to also create a store once they are logged in.
Currently only one store per user is supported. 

A user with a store can add, delete, or edit the items of their store.
